in this i'm going to refresh my knowledge on python and specially object oriented python 
and design pattern using python

it consists of three parts 
basic structured python
object oriented python
advanced object oriented design patterns


for basic i'm refering python for everybody by dr.Chuck

for object oriented python i'm refering python 3 object-oriented programming by Dusty Phillips

for advanced design pattern i'm refering Practical Python design patterns by wessel badenhorst

I've alraedy read all those books atleast once. no means I'm an expert if you want detailed explanation
just go through the book by yourself 

There are several books which are more advanced but for me these are enough I think



most of the concepts interchange and merge in all three different directories
