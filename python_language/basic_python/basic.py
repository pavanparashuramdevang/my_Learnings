"""
python is very easy to learn language 
the syntax is similer to normal english
but the problem is with speed of python and some people don't like the syntax 
like me i also like the curly braces syntax more than python as I worked a lot in c and c inspired languages
for basic it feels it's the best in syntax
but as we start to write complex code base it feels cluttered
for example for loop we can make it to iterate over any iterator which is good but as I said its depend
on preference and taste of the people

python is basically used for data science and AI which has every progarammer facing interface written in python
as I said all AI framework have interface written in python but to under the hood most 
still uses the C++ because of its execution efficiency

the good thing of learning python is, it can be used to write anything, build anything 
very easy to get started 
very good community
there always a tool to do anything like we can write an entire website from frontend, backend and everything
only in python without using javascript

it is possible, is it the best it's upto you

its a object oriented language but at begining no one uses the oop concepts which is ok as 
you can transition from language like c its very convinient 
as you program in structured manner in python also at begining
but in pytho everything is object, it doesn't enforce it on developer like JAVA in which

you must write in object oriented way which results in very sophisticated and reusable codebase of 
enterprices 

I'm not discouraging, what I'm saying is if you want to enter into an enterprice JAVA is still the best 
if you want to go on front end web development javascript with react/angular (as most used in industry )

if you want to enter into data science, AI which are the hot topic in the silicon vally now
python is must 

choos wisely as i think you can learn all the languages but you think in one to two language
thats also true for computer languages you think of solving problem in one language

#you can use # to comment a line 
#or you can use doc string i.e """ string inside three quotes ,to document

#indentation is very important in python and use editor which converts tab to space is preferred
#as python doesn't allow mix and match of space and tab


# for i in range(10):
#     for j in range(2):
#         print("this is wrong indented code")


#the above is mix and match of tab and space the code works I think editor just replaced tab to 4 spaces
#automaticaly, not all editor do the same i.e notepad in windows so use an editor 




print("hello world")

# decleration of explicit type is not required as python Interpreter assumes the specific type depending
# on the context i.e if and integer is not able to fit then it automatically converted to long
# float to double etc

#you can check type by printing type(object) on to screen example

print(type(3))

#it prints <class 'int'> that shows everything in python is belongs to certain class
