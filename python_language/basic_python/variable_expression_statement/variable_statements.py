"""
in python variables are assigned to type automatically by the interpreter

variable names
    there are some rules in choosing the names of variable i.e 
    --> the first letter not be a number
    --> var name consist of only one word words are joined using _ underscore

we mostly use snake case while using python but you can also use camel case or pascal case 
I suggest to stick with a perticuler case .I prefer snake case

statements:

    unlike in c and other related languages the stement is a sentence which ends with the ; semicolen 
    at the end

    but in python we use white space to indicate the statement i.e \n newline 

"""
