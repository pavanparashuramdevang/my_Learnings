basically in this section I'm going to refer book named

python 3 object-oriented programming by Dusty Phillips


in this book there are chapter explaining design pattern but I'm not going to explain those in this 
section I have made a dedicated section for explaining the object oriented programming so I think
its best explained there with in depth explanation and examples 


The chapters here are provides indepth explaination about all the required object oriented concepts 
related to python and how tho use them 

There are also chapters explaining testing 

There are about 10 chapters excluding all the design pattern based chapter 
I don't think those really affect like for this section you don't need to know about 
design pattern, this is seperate
