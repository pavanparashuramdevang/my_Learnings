you can see in the previous introduction we have impoted a package named math
and we use the methods and functions defined in their to do some computation


we will learn about how to orgaize those in python


modules -> these are simply python files 

    consider a python file calculator.py which is in the same directory 
    we can import it into our file just by specifying the name 


import calculator
    
    which import all the functions and methods in that file to working files
    we can access and use all the functions 


There are three main way of importing a module into your python file
Consider you have a file named calculator and in that file you have functions like addition 
subtraction and multiplication


import module_name
    the above is simple form where you need to specify filename first and using dot operator you can 
    access the functions for example in your working file you need to write program as follows
            import calculator

            a=calculator.add(1,2)  

                you can see you need to use module name before dot everytime while accessing the functions

from module_name import function_name
    I have written function_name name that may be anything module,data etc
    to use this you don't need to specify module name 
    dot operator is not required

            from calculator import subtraction

            a=subtraction(1,2)

                which directly provides the answer


    the one problem in this type is same function_name 
    consider there already a subtraction function in working file

    we can also solve that by aliasing like

            from calculator import subtraction as sub
            
            a=sub(2,4)

                though a function exists in file of similer name we can aliase them and make those differnt

from module_name import function1_name,function2_name

    the above is similer and using comma operator we can  import multiple function at a same time

from module_name import * 

    the above is not recomended as it causes some serious problems in namespace
    if similer names exists so pleas don't use it

modules are python files 

then we get the question like if python files can be orgrnized into folders
the same is true 

you can say python package is a collection of modules/files


you may thinking that you can make a folder and you can import module from that 
OK thats true but you need to do one simple step 

creating a   __init__.py   file in the folder

which tells the interpreter consider this folder as package


we can import package in two ways obsolute way  and relative way

consider a file structure


parent_directory/
    main.py 
    ecommerce/
        __init__.py
        database.py
        products.py
        calculator.py
        payments/
            __init__.py
            stripe.py
            square.py

from main.py we need to import subtraction function we use . dot notation to distinguish the hierarchy

Absolute import 
    import ecommerce.calculator

    sub_value=ecommerce.calculator.subtraction(4,5)

or
    from ecommerce.calculator import subtraction

    sub_value=subtraction(4,5)

or
    from ecommerce import calculator

    sub_value=calculator.subtraction(4,5)



Relative imports

    from .calculator import subtraction
    sub_value=subtraction(4,5)
